# Harvest
## A mini-game
<br>"Harvest" is a captivating mini-game created by using HTML, CSS & Javascript. In this game, there are three elements, square, circle ,rectangle, ——that are dynamically and randomly scattered across the landscape. 
But that is not the point! The point is every shape you draw , the items in that range will be counted. In the futue , if we can select the items in the screen (probably when shopping, it will automaticly add to your shopping cart , would it be nice and more efficient?)The game's objective is simple:  players can select a range on the map. Within this chosen area, the game automatically tallies the count of squares, circles, and rectangles, displaying the results prominently on the top-right corner of the screen. Simple operation of batch selection, The randomness of the elements generated each time brings surprises to the players, offering a delightful experience for all players. 
Pitfall: the sad part is the screen width is not allow to smaller than 1000px(the responsive design is not applied)
